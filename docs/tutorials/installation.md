Before installing the mod, please make sure you're running a **fabric** server (which you can download [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/server)), the mod *might* work on other mod loaders, but there's no guarantee and it definitely **will not** work on forge. Please do feel free to test and tell me on [discord](https://discord.offsetmonkey538.top) if it does or does not work on anything other than fabric.

Go to the Modrinth page ([here](https://modrinth.com/mod/github-resourcepack-manager)) and download the latest version.  
You'll also need to download the dependencies of the mod. Fabric Api can be found [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and MonkeyLib538 can be found [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/monkeylib538). Just download the latest version for the Minecraft version you're using.  
After you've downloaded the mod itself and its dependencies, just put them in your servers `mods` folder.

Now you're ready for the next step.
