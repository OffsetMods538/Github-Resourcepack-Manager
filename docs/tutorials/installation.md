Go to the Modrinth page ([here](https://modrinth.com/mod/github-resourcepack-manager)) and download the latest version.  
You'll also need to download the dependencies of the mod. Fabric Api can be found [here](TODO) and MonkeyLib538 can be found [here](TODO). Just download the latest version for the Minecraft version you're using.  
After you've downloaded the mod itself and its dependencies, just put them in your servers `mods` folder.

Now you're ready for the next step.
